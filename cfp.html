			<p>The Third Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking (APNet’19) aims to bring together the very best researchers in computer networking and systems across the Asia-Pacific region and around the globe to a live forum discussing innovative ideas at their early stages. The mission of APNet is that promising but not-yet-mature ideas can receive timely feedback from the community and experienced researchers, leading them into publications at major conferences such as SIGCOMM, NSDI, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, and CoNEXT. This year, it is will be closely located to SIGCOMM on August 17-18 in Beijing so that we can bring the larger community together.</p>
			
			<p>We invite submissions of short papers (up to 6 pages, including references) on a wide range of networking research, including, but not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Network architectures and algorithms</li>
				<li>Cloud and wide-area networking systems &amp; infrastructure</li>
				<li>Networking support for traditional and emerging applications (e.g., deep-learning and cryptocurrency)</li>
				<li>Operating system support for networking</li>
				<li>Kernel-bypass and RDMA networking and applications</li>
				<li>Enterprise, datacenter, and storage area networks</li>
				<li>SDN, NFV, and network programming</li>
				<li>Networking hardware design</li>
				<li>Network measurement, monitoring, diagnosis, and operations</li>
				<li>Formal methods and network verification</li>
				<li>Network security and privacy, censorship, transparency</li>
				<li>Network, transport, and application-layer protocols</li>
				<li>Resource management, QoS, and signaling</li>
				<li>Routing, traffic engineering, switching, and addressing</li>		
				<li>Wireless, mobile, and sensor networking</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The APNet Program Committee will select papers based on novelty, significance, and technical merit, rather than completeness. Innovative well-reasoned ideas with preliminary evaluations will suffice for APNet. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. We hope that the extension of APNet papers, when substantiated by solid implementation and experimentation, can be published at the aforementioned premier conferences.</p>
			
			<h1>Submission Instructions</h1>
			<!--<p><b><a href="https://apnet2019.hotcrp.com">https://apnet2019.hotcrp.com</a> is open for registration and submission.</b></p>-->
			
			<p>Submissions must be no longer than 6 pages (10 point font, 12 point leading) including all content and references. Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns. Each column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text.</p>
			
			<p>All submissions must be double-blind: submissions must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader). Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers and papers under simultaneous submission (e.g., the extension of APNet submission with complete implementation/experiments may be submitted simultaneously elsewhere). </p>
			
			<p> If you are using LaTeX, you may make use of <a href="https://github.com/scyue/latex-sigcomm18">this template for ACM conference proceedings</a>. With the older versions of this template you *must add “10pt” to the documentclass command to meet the submission requirements. The current template sets 10pt by default. (Unlike the official template, it only includes example for conference proceedings.)</p>
